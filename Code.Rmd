Here are the effects of each variable
```{r}
# Capacity interpretations
sd(AllData$Capacity)

# increasing capacity by 23,200 people increases the odds of winning at home by 3.36 times for baseball. However this number doesn't make sense since we have such a range in values. Therefore we need to do it by a fraction 

#baseball SE is 1039.8813 so 1039.8813/23200=0.0448
exp(1.21418*.263) # increase baseball stadium by 6,116 people 37% increase
#basketball SE is 6116.0482 so 6116.0482/23,200=.263
exp(1.21418*0.04482247 +  0.97581) # basketball increasing capacity increases the odds of winning by 2.8 times
#football SE is 11875.7172 so 11875.7172/23200=.511
exp(1.21418*0.5118844 +  -1.85881) # football increasing capacity decreases the odds of winning by 70.9%
#hockey SE is 998.3133 so 998.3133/23200=0.043
exp(1.21418*0.043 +  -5.12141) # hockey increasing capacity decreases the odds of winning by 99%


# Type Sport Interpretations
exp(2.38943) # basketball has 10.9 times more likely to win in home court than baseball
exp(1.09150) # football is 3 times more likely to win in home court than baseball
exp(-3.19716) # hockey is 96% less likely to win in home court than baseball

# makes sense because baseball stadiums are all different shapes, maybe hockey you cannot hear fans so home court doesn't matter

# Attendence Interpretations
sd(AllData$Attendence)

# increasing attendance by 18.12 percent decreases the odds of winning at home by 6% but this changes based on sport and capacity. So if Baseball is the baseline, 6%
exp(-0.06179)
exp(-0.06179+ 0.32640) # basketball 30% increase
exp(-0.06179+-0.85513) # football 60% decrease
exp(-0.06179+0.88390) # hockey is 2.3 times increase

# interaction between capacity and attendance
exp(0.62979*.263) # 1.2 times more baseball, so increase one and the effect of the other increases by 20%
exp(0.62979*0.04482247) # 1.02 times more basketball, so increase one and the effect of the other increases by 2%
exp(0.62979*0.5118844) # 1.38 times more football, so increase one and the effect of the other increases by 38%
exp(0.62979*0.043) # 1.027 times more hockey, so increase one and the effect of the other increases by 2.7%


# Franchise value interpretations
sd(AllData$FranchiseValue)
# increasing franchise value by 93,5646,568 increases odds of winning at home by 14%
exp(0.13274) 

# population interpretations
sd(AllData$Population)
# increasing a state's population by 11,921,447 decreases the odds of a home win by 62% but don't forget about interaction
exp(-0.96189)

# interaction is 24% increase, so increases happiness effect by 24%
exp(0.21383)

# happy interpretation
# increasing happiness by 1, increases odds of winning at home by 17%
exp(0.15703)

# year opened
# increasing the year a stadium opened decreases the odds of winning by 8%, potentially older well established teams have better winning records while newer teams with newer stadiums do not have same legacy
